### Why should I contribute to this free & open-source library?
We all love free and open-source libraries! But there is a catch... nothing is free in this world.

We NEED your help. Last year alone, we spent over **3000 hours** maintaining all our open source libraries.

Contributions allow us to spend more of our time on: Bug Fix, Development, Documentation, and Support.

### How much should I contribute?
Any amount is much appreciated. All our free libraries together have more than **100 million** downloads.

If everyone could contribute a tiny amount, it would help us make the .NET community a better place to code!

Another great free way to contribute is  **spreading the word** about the library.

A **HUGE THANKS** for your help!
